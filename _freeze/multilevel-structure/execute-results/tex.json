In multilevel analysis, the groups are often schools, neighborhoods, communities, or countries.\n\nA model that is \"aware\" of the clustered nature of the data may provide very different--likely better--substantive conclusions than a model that is not aware of the clustered nature of the data. This phenomena is closely related to the \"ecological fallacy\": the idea that group level and individual level relationships are not necessarily the same [@FIREBAUGH20014023].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Graphs\n\n### A \"Naive\" Graph \n\nThis \"naive\" graph is unaware of the grouped nature of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel-structure_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### An \"Aware\" Graph \n\nThis \"aware\" graph is aware of the grouped nature of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel-structure_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Regressions\n\n### A \"Naive\" OLS Analysis\n\nThe OLS model with only *x* as a covariate is not aware of the grouped structure of the data, and the coefficient for *x* reflects this.\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                          OLS2  \n--------------------------------\nx                      -0.761 **\nIntercept              57.057 **\nNumber of observations     30   \n--------------------------------\n** p<.01, * p<.05\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### An \"Aware\" MLM Analysis\n\nThe multilevel model is aware of the grouped structure of the data, and the coefficient for *x* reflects this.\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                          MLM2   \n---------------------------------\nx                        1.166 **\nIntercept               27.192 **\nvar(_cons)             312.623   \nvar(e)                   0.806   \nNumber of observations      30   \n---------------------------------\n** p<.01, * p<.05\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Compare The Models\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                          OLS2      MLM2   \n-------------------------------------------\nx                      -0.761 **   1.166 **\nIntercept              57.057 **  27.192 **\nvar(_cons)                       312.623   \nvar(e)                             0.806   \nNumber of observations     30         30   \n-------------------------------------------\n** p<.01, * p<.05\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## A Thought Experiment\n\nWhen might a situation like this arise in practice? This is surprisingly difficult to think through. \n\nImagine that *x* is a protective factor, or an intervention or treatment. Imagine that *y* is a desirable outcome, like improved mental health or psychological well being.\n\nNow imagine that people provide more of the protective factor or more of the intervention in communities where there are lower levels of the desirable outcome. If we think about it, this is a very plausible situation. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### A Naive Analysis Would Misconstrue The Results\n\nA naive analysis that was unaware of the grouped nature of the data would therefore misconstrue the results, suggesting that the intervention was harmful, when it was in fact helpful.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel-structure_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese data are constructed to provide this kind of extreme example, but it easy to see how multilevel analysis may provide better answers than we would get if we ignored the grouped nature of the data.\n\n\n\n",
