I still do it.\" [Mary Oliver in @Oliver2015]\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis site contains materials for a workshop on multilevel modeling.\n\n## Background\n\nMultilevel models are useful when you have data that are nested or clustered inside social units such as schools, neighborhoods, states, or countries.\n\nMultilevel models are also useful when you have longitudinal data where repeated measures are collected for study participants.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### The Importance of Multilevel Models\n\nMultilevel models may improve one's statistical inferences in two important substantive ways.\n\n* Multilevel models adjust standard errors for clustering, and thus calculate appropriate p values. Failure to use a model that accounts for the clustering in the data may lead to improperly calculated standard errors and p values, possibly leading to false attributions of statistical significance (false positives). (See @sec-clustering).\n* Multilevel models adjust regression coefficients ($\\beta$'s) for the presence of clustering. Failure to use a model that accounts for the clustering in the data may lead to improperly calculated regression coefficients ($\\beta$'s) which may have the wrong magnitude, the wrong statistical significance, and even the wrong sign.\n:::\n\n## Simulated Multilevel Data\n\nThe data used in these workshop materials are *simulated* data on parents, children and families. The data are simulated to come from 30 hypothetical countries around the world. These are the same data used and discussed in my book *[Multilevel Thinking: Discovering Variation, Universals, and Particulars in Cross-Cultural Research](https://academic.oup.com/book/60530)*.\n\nThere are two versions of the data: a *cross-sectional* data set from a single point in time; a *longitudinal* version of the data spanning several time points.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### The Data Can Be Downloaded Here:\n\n* [Cross Sectional Data](https://github.com/agrogan1/multilevel-workshop/raw/refs/heads/main/simulated_multilevel_data.dta)\n* [Longitudinal Data](https://github.com/agrogan1/multilevel-workshop/raw/refs/heads/main/simulated_multilevel_longitudinal_data.dta)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-describe .cell tbl-cap='Variables in Simulated Multilevel Data'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n pos        variable                    label             \n----- --------------------- ------------------------------\n  1          country                  country id          \n\n  2            HDI             Human Development Index    \n\n  3          family                   family id           \n\n  4            id              unique country family id   \n\n  5         identity         hypothetical identity group  \n                                       variable           \n\n  6       intervention          recieved intervention     \n\n  7    physical_punishment   physical punishment in past  \n                                         week             \n\n  8          warmth          parental warmth in past week \n\n  9          outcome              beneficial outcome      \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-head .cell tbl-cap='Sample Data From Simulated Multilevel Data'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n country   HDI   family    id     identity   intervention   physical_punishment   warmth   outcome \n--------- ----- -------- ------- ---------- -------------- --------------------- -------- ---------\n   17      87      45     17.45      0            0                  3              5       53.99  \n\n   27      43      43     27.43      1            1                  4              1       53.67  \n\n    6      39      61     6.61       0            1                  1              3       61.75  \n\n   13      74      59     13.59      1            0                  2              6       49.45  \n\n   24      82      9      24.9       0            1                  4              2       43.65  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
