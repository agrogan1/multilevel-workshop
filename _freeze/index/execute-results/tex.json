The data are simulated to come from 30 hypothetical countries around the world.\n\nThere are two versions of the data: a *cross-sectional* data set from a single point in time; a *longitudinal* version of the data spanning several time points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-describe .cell-output-display}\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n pos        variable                    label             \n----- --------------------- ------------------------------\n  1          country                  country id          \n\n  2            HDI             Human Development Index    \n\n  3          family                   family id           \n\n  4            id              unique country family id   \n\n  5         identity         hypothetical identity group  \n                                       variable           \n\n  6       intervention          recieved intervention     \n\n  7    physical_punishment   physical punishment in past  \n                                         week             \n\n  8          warmth          parental warmth in past week \n\n  9          outcome              beneficial outcome      \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSimulated Multilevel Data\n:::\n:::\n",
