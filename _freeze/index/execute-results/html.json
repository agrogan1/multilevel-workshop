The data are simulated to come from 30 hypothetical countries around the world.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(Statamarkdown)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\n\nuse \"simulated_multilevel_data.dta\", clear\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\n\ndescribe // describe the data\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
